	// Begin SCM Lighthouse RX Demo
	// ----------------------------
	// This is meant to be a barebones proof of concept for how to process lighthouse signals on SCM.
	// BW 7-27-19

	// Algorithm
	// ----
	// Continuously poll GPIO<3> which is connected to the output of optical receiver.
	// Look for rising and falling edges and measure the pulse widths between the two.
	// An FSM is used to look for a sequence of Az-Sync | Az-Sweep | El-Sync | El-Sweep
	// If those four pulses are found in order, 
	// the times between rising edges for the sync->laser pulses are printed,
	// Azimuth printed first, elevation second.
	// If a full valid measurement isn't acquired, don't print anything.
	
		
	// Hardware Setup - these were all already done above in initialize_mote()
	// -----
	// The first four GPIO outputs must be set to Bank 0 (to get optical debug signals)
	// The first four GPIO inputs must be set to Bank 0 (to get Cortex GP inputs)
	// Both input and output directions for those banks must be enabled
	// Need to lower always on supply to keep from glitching
	// Set RFTimer source to HF_CLOCK (20MHz) and its divider to divide by 2
	// Set HCLK source to HF_CLOCK (20MHz) and its divider to divide by 2
	// This results in both HCLK (the Cortex) and RFTimer running at 10 MHz


	// Possible improvements and alternative implementation options:
	// ----
	// 1)
	// Rather than polling GPIO<3>, it would probably be preferable to use interrupts,
	// but SCM doesn't have an easy way to only trigger an ISR on rise/fall edges.
	// If the signal is still high when the ISR finishes running, it will execute again.
	// This might be a problem for the long duration of the sync pulses.
	// One possibility might be to plug into two interrupts, one active low and one active high,
	// then ping-ping back and forth between the two enabling/disabling as needed.
	// These issues are probably mitigated if the sync pulses are replaced with RF.
	// Note that using interrupts will require physically connecting the optical RX output
	// to a different GPIO pin that serves as an interrupt.
	
	
	// 2)
	// There is another counter connected to HF_CLOCK that could be used instead of RFTimer
	// If you need RFTimer to do radio timing, then may be forced to use this other counter.
	// It is not as easy to read from but should work; see optical_cal section for how to read/reset
	
	
	// 3)
	// The timing difference between the two rising edges of az/el sync pulses could be used
	// to make a better estimate of time between sync and sweep rising edges.
	// The 10 MHz SCM clock is not all that accurate - probably +/- 1500ppm after calibration.
	// Since you know how many ticks there should be in an ideal 10 MHz clock between the two
	// sync pulses, you should be able to estimate the error in the SCM 10 MHz clock.
	// Ex: there should be 83,333 10MHz ticks in 8.333ms; if instead the average number of 
	// ticks you were getting between sync pulse rising edges was 83,210 then you know that 
	// the SCM 10 MHz clock is too slow by about 1500ppm, and can apply a correction to the
	// measurements between sync and sweep.
	
	// 4)
	// You may be able to run HCLK/RFTimer faster than 10 MHz if desired.  Probably need to raise
	// the supply voltage for VDDD in order to do so.  Simply trying to go to 20 MHz was not 
	// working when tried with the board used to develop this demo.
	
	// 5)
	// Note that some issues were seen depending on what was configurtion was happening in 
	// initialize_mote().  Random glitches can occur in the output of the optical RX depending on 
	// other mote settings.  The settings used in this demo seem to work, but if the radio is needed
	// then more configuration must happen inside initialize_mote().  If adding those changes causes
	// the lighthouse RX to stop working then try disabling those new changes one by one to isolate
	// the cause.
